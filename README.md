# insightQL
easily integrated query engine for server (backend) or client (frontend) services. It integrates just as any other microservice would, independently (stateless). Makes it simple to implement complex database queries into applications. Builds queries as events are consumed. insightQL is designed to perform queries over large segments of data, and is not designed for point reads and updates of single rows of data. insightQL must be adaptive not only to different query characteristics, but also combinations of characteristics. Without adaptiveness, it would be necessary to narrowly partition workloads and tune configuration for each workload independently. That approach does not scale to the wide variety of query shapes seen in production.
